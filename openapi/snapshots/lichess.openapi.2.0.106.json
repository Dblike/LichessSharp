    "description": "# Introduction\nWelcome to the reference for the Lichess API! Lichess is free/libre,\nopen-source chess server powered by volunteers and donations.\n- Get help in the [Lichess Discord channel](https://discord.gg/lichess)\n- API demo app with OAuth2 login and gameplay: [source](https://github.com/lichess-org/api-demo) / [demo](https://lichess-org.github.io/api-demo/)\n- API UI app with OAuth2 login and endpoint forms: [source](https://github.com/lichess-org/api-ui) / [website](https://lichess.org/api/ui)\n- [Contribute to this documentation on Github](https://github.com/lichess-org/api)\n- Check out [Lichess widgets to embed in your website](https://lichess.org/developers)\n- [Download all Lichess rated games](https://database.lichess.org/)\n- [Download all Lichess puzzles with themes, ratings and votes](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles)\n- [Download all evaluated positions](https://database.lichess.org/#evals)\n\n## Endpoint\nAll requests go to `https://lichess.org` (unless otherwise specified).\n\n## Clients\n- [Python general API](https://github.com/lichess-org/berserk)\n- [MicroPython general API](https://github.com/mkomon/uberserk)\n- [Python general API - async](https://pypi.org/project/async-lichess-sdk)\n- [Python Lichess Bot](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot)\n- [Python Board API for Certabo](https://github.com/haklein/certabo-lichess)\n- [Java general API](https://github.com/tors42/chariot)\n- [JavaScript & TypeScript general API](https://github.com/devjiwonchoi/equine)\n- [LichessNET - C# API Wrapper](https://github.com/Rabergsel/LichessNET)\n\n## Rate limiting\nAll requests are rate limited using various strategies,\nto ensure the API remains responsive for everyone.\nOnly make one request at a time.\nIf you receive an HTTP response with a [429 status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#429),\nplease wait a full minute before resuming API usage.\n\n## Streaming with ND-JSON\nSome API endpoints stream their responses as [Newline Delimited JSON a.k.a. **nd-json**](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec), with one JSON object per line.\n\nHere's a [JavaScript utility function](https://gist.github.com/ornicar/a097406810939cf7be1df8ea30e94f3e) to help reading NDJSON streamed responses.\n\n## Authentication\n### Which authentication method is right for me?\n[Read about the Lichess API authentication methods and code examples](https://github.com/lichess-org/api/blob/master/example/README.md)\n\n### Personal Access Token\nPersonal API access tokens allow you to quickly interact with Lichess API without going through an OAuth flow.\n- [Generate a personal access token](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token)\n- `curl https://lichess.org/api/account -H \"Authorization: Bearer {token}\"`\n- [NodeJS example](https://github.com/lichess-org/api/tree/master/example/oauth-personal-token)\n\n### Token Security\n- Keep your tokens secret. Do not share them in public repositories or public forums.\n- Your tokens can be used to make your account perform arbitrary actions (within the limits of the tokens' scope). You remain responsible for all activities on your account.\n- Do not hardcode tokens in your application's code. Use environment variables or a secure storage and ensure they are not shipped/exposed to users. Be especially careful that they are not included in frontend bundles or apps that are shipped to users.\n- If you suspect a token has been compromised, revoke it immediately.\n\nTo see your active tokens or revoke them, see [your Personal API access tokens](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token).\n\n### Authorization Code Flow with PKCE\nThe authorization code flow with PKCE allows your users to **login with Lichess**.\nLichess supports unregistered and public clients (no client authentication, choose any unique client id).\nThe only accepted code challenge method is `S256`.\nAccess tokens are long-lived (expect one year), unless they are revoked.\nRefresh tokens are not supported.\n\nSee the [documentation for the OAuth endpoints](#tag/OAuth) or\nthe [PKCE RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-4) for a precise protocol description.\n\n- [Demo app](https://lichess-org.github.io/api-demo/)\n- [Minimal client-side example](https://github.com/lichess-org/api/tree/master/example/oauth-app)\n- [Flask/Python example](https://github.com/lakinwecker/lichess-oauth-flask)\n- [Java example](https://github.com/tors42/lichess-oauth-pkce-app)\n- [NodeJS Passport strategy to login with Lichess OAuth2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-lichess)\n\n#### Real life examples\n- [PyChess](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants) ([source code](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants))\n- [Lichess4545](https://www.lichess4545.com/) ([source code](https://github.com/cyanfish/heltour))\n- [English Chess Federation](https://ecf.octoknight.com/)\n- [Rotherham Online Chess](https://rotherhamonlinechess.azurewebsites.net/tournaments)\n\n### Token format\nAccess tokens and authorization codes match `^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$`.\nThe length of tokens can be increased without notice. Make sure your application can handle at least 512 characters.\nBy convention tokens have a recognizable prefix, but do not rely on this.\n"

Account requirements will be imposed on an event-by-event basis sufficient to accomplish Lichess Fair Play Review and discourage unethical participation. \r\n\r\nDISQUALIFICATION AND EJECTION: The organizer, at the organizer's sole discretion and with or without Lichess confirmation, may disqualify, limit and/or remove any player from any event on suspicion of cheating or other violation of organizer, event or Lichess rules. \r\n\r\nRATING MANIPULATION: Players intentionally lowering their rating to enter a tournament with a rating limit will NOT be eligible for prizes. Please note that such rating manipulation, including playing under another's account or a new account, is considered cheating. \r\n\r\nMEMBERSHIP & REGISTRATION: All players participating in a CSCA tournament are considered \"event members\" of the CSCA without registration. Unless required in the description of the tournament, registration is optional. \r\n\r\nPRIZES: All players winning event prizes will be contacted via Lichess message for their PayPal information. Players winning in excess of $600 in a calendar year, must submit U.S. IRS form W-9 or international equivalent to the CSCA ahead of receiving payment of event prizes. Prizes are paid at least seven (7) days after the conclusion of the event (more if needed), to allow FairPlay Review and processing. Any imposed fees or taxes may reduce the final amount of the received prize. Lichess accounts that are not in good standing are prize ineligible. Prizes not claimed within thirty (30) days after the event are deemed abandoned. \r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nCSCA Admin\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\n\r\n**RESULTS**\r\n\r\nNext results coming December 4. \r\n\r\nPast winners: https://www.chessct.org/csca/Uploads/Winners.pdf\r\nTOTAL PRIZES AWARDED since Sept 2023: $12,000",
